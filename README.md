### Using supertest to make tests for some publicly available REST APIs

### Notes

-   This package is not intended to be used as a library.
-   Rather published referense code, which can be easily run
-   I might consider extracting some of techniques used here and create a tiny library later.

### Why

-   Test that referense public API are actually usable from your location
-   Can be used as sample code on how to write basic tests for REST API
-   You can use it as a sort of traffic generator ))

### Use

```sh
npx funtest@latest
```
